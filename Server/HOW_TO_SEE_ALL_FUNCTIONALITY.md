## 🎯 **Method 5: Direct API Testing**

Use any HTTP client (Postman, curl, etc.) to test endpoints:

### **Base Analysis**

```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-base
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "baseLayout": "TH10 with centralized town hall",
  "defensePositions": ["Archer Tower at (100,150)"],
  "wallConfiguration": "Layered walls",
  "resourceTargets": ["Gold Storage"]
}
```

### **Deployment Optimization**

```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/optimize-deployment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "baseType": "farming",
  "armyComposition": ["20 Giants", "100 Archers"],
  "availableSpells": ["Heal", "Rage"],
  "targetPriority": "resources"
}
```
